# 3.03 Activity 2

Keep working on the `bank` database.

In this example we will simulate a suspicious transactions check - where we look for the same amount being moved on the same date and the same account. Although it is unlikely that these transactions were made in error or fraudulent, this is one of the regular checks and balances the bank does. 

Using the trans table, perform a self join (the transaction table joined to itself) to identify on which accounts, and for which different transaction IDs, the same amount is moved on the same date. hint: perform the join using account_id, not trans_id. 

Remember to alias your tables!
